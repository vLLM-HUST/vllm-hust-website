# MOD throughput comparisons

The existing plugin cards show one number: output-throughput change from a published matched
comparison. Cards sort by this number descending, including negative results. A missing comparison
is a dash, never zero. No extra results section or qualification status paragraphs are rendered on
the cards.

`data/plugin-performance.json` stores one or more model-scoped observations for each entry and
groups complete Frontier observations with the Native series from their published campaign. Each
entry explicitly names one default observation for the all-model view; a model-filtered view selects
only the observation for that model. Results from different models are never averaged together.
`assets/plugin-performance.js` reads actual Frontier throughput values and computes
`(geometric_mean(candidate_tps / native_tps) - 1) * 100` across C1/2/4/8/16. Every load receives
equal weight. The Frontier link tooltip exposes the aggregation and per-load percentages. No scores
are stored in metadata. Current Frontier campaigns bind observation IDs to their Native series
centrally; older published observations retain one or more raw candidate/baseline throughput pairs
so the page recomputes their geometric mean rather than storing a percentage.

## Existing BetterScale data

The complete small-fish series and the existing capacity16 Native series have matching model
revision, runtime base commits, workload/tokenizer fingerprints, hardware topology, explicit 24.25
GiB/chip KV budget, context, slots, batching, APC, async scheduling and natural MTP2. Both use
900-second fixed-window streamed-token accounting, excluding drain. Their client revisions differ
only in repository documentation, as recorded in [the source evidence](FRONTIER-SMALL-FISH.md).

Graph/capture settings, task-queue settings and MOD workers are treatment configuration differences:
BetterScale uses its FULL graph path while Native uses FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. The reported number is
observed end-to-end throughput relative to Native, not an isolated kernel ablation. Both curves are
single smoke observations. The Native C16 retrieval caveat recorded in
[the original report](FRONTIER-QWEN35-SWE-PREFIX.md) remains; throughput comparisons do not certify
answer quality or repeatability. No original measurements or caveats are removed.

The five throughput changes are +16.87%, +30.44%, +46.63%, +57.55%, and +66.22%; their geometric
aggregate is +42.39%. This complete series is selected explicitly, rather than selecting the best
point independently at each load or substituting the newer single resident-state C16 observation.

## Later unified campaign

BidKV, DLA, Tiering, Mooncake and KVCompression use the single five-point Native curve from their
later unified campaign. Pipeline's complete TP2/PP2 campaign uses its published five-point Native
curve. vSpec, DiffSpec, LatchMoE and KV Materialization Arrival Control use raw paired throughput
values from their linked public reports. The KV Materialization result covers three matched rounds
on each of two workloads and reports the controller against `always_full_reuse`; its six-pair
geometric mean is a small regression. The validator excludes incompatible Frontier identities and
malformed published pairs.

ECPA launch/adapter/analysis metadata remains in the data file. It is not injected into the
performance card or used to invent a performance score.

## ECPA acceptance evidence

The eleven historical performance entries are not eleven ECPA certifications. The same
`plugin-performance/v6` record keeps three facts independent: archived performance evidence, ECPA
launch acceptance, and analysis integration. The 2026-09-27 campaign records are:

| Entries                                                                    | ECPA launch acceptance                                                                                          | Analysis path                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| KV Tiering                                                                 | Manager-verified                                                                                                | External specialized harness |
| Ascend KV Compression                                                      | Manager-verified                                                                                                | External specialized harness |
| AscendStoreConnector + Mooncake                                            | Manager-verified through a supplemental Provider profile; `vLLM-HUST/extension-manager#8` remains an open draft | External specialized harness |
| BidKV, DLA, Pipeline Microbatch                                            | Performance runs used project-specific scripts; no unified ECPA launch acceptance                               | External specialized harness |
| BetterScale, vSpec, LatchMoE, DiffSpec, KV Materialization Arrival Control | Existing public results only; not reproduced through ECPA in this round                                         | External/published analysis  |

For all eleven entries, request collection, throughput/latency recomputation, baseline pairing, and
Frontier import remain outside the manager. `check`, `status`, and `plan` validate configuration and
state; they are not performance-analysis operations. A manager-launched run therefore does not by
itself establish an integrated experiment workflow or runtime effectiveness.

The campaign also observed a process-release defect: after the manager exited, API/worker processes
and device memory could remain until the experiment supervisor cleaned them up. The machine-readable
boundary keeps this as `known-defect` and links the retained incident record. Do not promote process
exit or resource release to accepted until signal forwarding, descendant waiting, and device-memory
release have an independent regression result.
